	 *  
	 *        
 *  Void return type keywords:      
	 *        in java, return type is manditory if a menthod wont return anything then we have to declaire that method with VOID return type
	 *        But in c language return type is optional, default return type is 'int'
	 *        
 *  Un-Used Keywords :  
	 *  
	 *    1. goto : usage of goto created several problems in old languages and hence SUN people Banned this keyword in java.
	 *    
	 *    2.const : use final instead of const.
	 *    
		    Goto and Const are unused kwywords and if we are trying to use we will get compile time error.
	 *     
 *   Enum (1.5v) : if we want to define group of named constants,  
	 *       
	 *       enum month {
	 *       jan, feb, march, ..... dec;
	 *       }
	 *       
	 *       enum beer{
	 *       
	 *       KF, Ko, RC, FO;
	 *       }
 *   Conclusions:
	 *    1. all 53 reserved words contains alphabet with lowercase alphabet symbols.
	 *    
	 *    2.  in java only we have 'new' keyword, 'delete' keyword is not there in java, because destrution of useless  object is responsiblity of garbage Collector.
	 *    
 *        3. The following are new keywords in java: 
			 *              strictfp ----- 1.2v
			 *              assert --------1.4v
			 *               enum --------1.5v
			 *               
*   strictfp, instanceof, synchronized, extends, implements, import, const.
*   
*   which of the following list contains only java reserved words:
*    new, delete
*    goto, constant,
*    break,continue, return, exit
*    final, finally, finalize,
*    throw,throws,thrown,
*    notify, notifyAll.
*    implements, extends, imports,
*    sizeof,instanceof
*    instanceOf, strictFp,
*    byte,short,Int,
